I am Chang Liu. I am currently a visiting student at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the United States and a final-year Ph.D. candidate at the University of New South Wales (UNSW), Sydney, Australia. I expect to complete my Ph.D. study by February 2024. My dissertation has been submitted and is currently under review. I earned a Bachelor of Civil Engineering degree at the University of Science and Technology Beijing and a Master of Philosophy at UNSW.

My research focused on the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in geospatial engineering and remote sensing for natural disaster-related research and have been keeping up to date with the development of state-of-the-art technologies in the discipline. Semantic segmentation models for post-disaster building damage assessment with both two-dimensional and three-dimensional data have been proposed with codes written in Python.
