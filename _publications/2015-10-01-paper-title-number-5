excerpt: 'This paper aims to present seven algorithms to detect panel edges and statistically compare their performance through application on two scenarios of buildings in construction sites. Two different scenarios are selected, where the building fa√ßades are available to the public, and a sample of 100 images is taken using a state-of-the-art 3D camera for edge detection analysis. '
