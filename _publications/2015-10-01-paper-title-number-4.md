excerpt: 'This paper proposes an improved model-based forest height inversion method for airborne L-band dual-baseline repeat-pass polarimetric synthetic aperture radar interferometry (PolInSAR) collections. A two-layer physical model with various volumetric scattering attenuation and dynamic motion properties is first designed based on the traditional Random Motion over Ground (RMoG) model.'
